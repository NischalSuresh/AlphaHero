This is program to highlight in red colour, the dark or light regions of a colour image, and save the image. Additionally the greyscale and binary images are also saved. 
The user inputs the image and his choice of region to be highlighted (dark or light)
Check pixel strength > 70 when highlighting light areas and pixel strength < 170 when highlighting dark areas. (Values of 70 and 170) are chosen specifically for this problem set. These values can be changes to any other value based on suitability
The results are achieved with one nested for loop
